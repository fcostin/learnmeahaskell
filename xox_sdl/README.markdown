SDL noughts and crosses
=======================

Overview
--------

A quick and nasty `SDL` interface for a noughts-and-crosses game against the computer.

Notes: getting started with SDL
-------------------------------

1.  install the `SDL` package:

        cabal install SDL

2.  the blog post [intro-to-sdl-with-haskell](http://abstractabsurd.blogspot.com/2008/04/intro-to-sdl-with-haskell.html) describes the basic incantations to get a screen up with event handling.

3.  then, figure stuff out by staring at the [documentation for Haskell `SDL` bindings](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SDL)
