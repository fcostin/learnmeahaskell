multithreaded SDL noughts and crosses
=====================================

Overview
--------

A multithreaded variant of the `xox_sdl` code for noughts-and-crosses. This means the AI
can run in its own thread while the UI can remain responsive in another thread.

TODO: speed up the AI by making it cache game states.
